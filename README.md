# Unnamed App
The need for this app came from an event I worked where people signed up with Google Form to have their dog's portrait taken.  After the event there was a lot of work to parse users' information and to match that to the dog photos.  


## Technologies used
- **NextJS**
- **React** 
- **PostgresQL**

### Future Goals
I am expanding on the idea to make user registration and matching users with their dogs easier.
